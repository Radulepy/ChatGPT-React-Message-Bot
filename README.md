## Features

- **Frontend:** The frontend part of the template is built with React and utilizes Material UI 5.x for the user interface components.
- **Backend API:** The backend API is implemented using Node.js and Express framework.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up and run the ChatGPT Message Bot:

0) Install the needed dependencies `npm i` in the root folder

1) Set your ChatGPT's API Bearer Token in `src/ChatService.ts` in the `CHAT_GPT_BEARER_TOKEN` variable

2) Start the `chat-bot-api` project by runing: `npx tsc` and `node dist/server.js` in the `/chat-bot-api` project path!
This will ensure the backend will run on port 4000.

3) Start the `chat-bot` project by runing:
`npm start` in the `/chat-bot` project path!
This will start the frontend project on port 3000.

## Usage

Once the ChatGPT Message Bot is up and running, you can interact with it through the frontend interface. Open your web browser and access `http://localhost:3000` to start using the bot.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the template according to your specific requirements. You can modify the frontend components, add additional features, or extend the backend functionality as needed.
